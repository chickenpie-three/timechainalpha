| Medium | Content creation delays impacting launch timeline and consistent delivery. | Establish a detailed content calendar with clear deadlines and assign responsible parties. Engage freelance writers/analysts as needed to supplement internal capacity. Prioritize core launch content early in the project. |
| Low | GDPR/CCPA compliance issues leading to legal penalties. | Implement explicit consent mechanisms for data collection, provide clear privacy policies, and ensure data handling processes align with regulations. Consult with legal counsel to review compliance measures. |
| High | High churn rate for premium subscribers due to perceived lack of value. | Continuously gather user feedback through surveys and analytics.
